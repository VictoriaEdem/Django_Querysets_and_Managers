# Django_Querysets_and_Managers
Task from I4GxZuri training:

This python script contains more features built for the URL shortener service introduced in "working_with_APIs". 

The purpose of these new features is because I want users of the API to view all active links. I also want to provide users with an endpoint to view Links created during the week.
